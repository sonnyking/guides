Guides v0.5.0
==============

A really light weight lib to allow in-browser alignment during UI/UX development. Modeled after similar tools used by the design community it allows a developer to quickly check alignment across columns and rows. Press the [r] and [g] keys on your keyboard to give them a try.

It began as a simple exploration of Chrome's Shadow DOM, in the future it'll be ported to all modern browsers. Please feel free to fork, extend or otherwise contribute.

It's pretty simple, just add the script tag to your html - bam your ready to go.
